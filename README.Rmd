## Background

The contents of this repo were presented at various Huddles in February 2024 to BNSSG colleagues.

## Cloning

To clone this repo use:

```
git clone https://github.com/nhs-bnssg-analytics/fingertips.git

## Recreating the presentation

On starting the project, `renv` should initialise and offer you help to recreate the package environment.

Within the outputs folder, there is a `fingertipsR and fingertipscharts.qmd` file. Open this in RStudio and Render it. It should provide the images presented at the meeting above.
